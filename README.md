So far, the only thing to mention in this README is that this is a quick trading engine I started building as a fun project.  I will add to it as time goes on but for now it uses Linear Regression, Geometric Brownian Motion, and GARCH to determine whether or not we want to buy or sell at a certain point in time, as well as how many shares to buy or sell.  At the moment this does not have a strategy that makes money but is instead a project created to try my hand at developing this type of trading process and learn what I can along the way.
